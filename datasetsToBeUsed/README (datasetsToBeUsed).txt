If you want to run the code directly on colab, please upload all the files under this folder (do not include folder "datasetsToBeUsed", only sub folders and csv files) directly to the MyDrive/ folder of google drive. And then, follow the txt file in sub folder "glove", because the file is too big to upload on Github, download the file from website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielwillgeorge/glove6b100dtxt in the subfolder "golve". 

In this folder called "datasetsToBeUsed", there are 6 sub folders and four CSV files. The reason why not all CSV files are placed in subfolders is because in the path of actual codes for the ISOT and FakeNewsNet (gossipcop) datasets, CSV files are not placed in subfolders. Therefore, in order to run the code files more conveniently and directly without modification, the ISOT and FakeNewsNet (gossipcop) datasets are placed directly in the "datasetsToBeUsed" folder, rather than in a subfolder. Please note that Fake.csv and True.csv belong to the ISOT dataset, gossipcop_real.csv and gossipcop_fake.csv belongs to the FakeNewsNet(gossipcop) dataset.
