Here are all documented codes. 

The folder named NEW-*** is the original model, and the folder named HIGH-*** is the best result of the model after using the tuning hyperparameter. The folder named NEWUP-*** is the result of the original model after upsampling, and the folder HIGHUP-*** is the best result obtained by the model after tuning hyperparameter after upsampling. For the ipynb files under these types of folders, those with ”no“ in the name are the result of not using preprocessing technology (the result may be better), and the files without “no” are the result of using conventional preprocessing technology.

Under the transfer-learning folder are files for all transfer learning attempts.

Under the dataToBeUsed folder are datasets that may be used in all ipynb files. If you want to run the code directly on colab, please upload all the files in this folder directly to the MyDrive/ folder of google drive. If there is a error that the dataset cannot be found in the file whose name contains "pheme", please download the dataset from the website below and change the path in the code by yourself. https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PHEME_dataset_for_Rumour_Detection_and_Veracity_Classification/6392078
Also, please download the glove.6B.100d.txt under code files\datasetsToBeUsed\glove\ from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielwillgeorge/glove6b100dtxt

If you want to run the code, please upload all folders (please include folders) directly to the MyDrive/ path of google drive.
